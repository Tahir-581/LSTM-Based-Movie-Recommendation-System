# 🎬 LSTM-Based Movie Recommendation System  

This project is a **movie recommendation system** that uses an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network** to predict the next movie a user might watch based on their past viewing history. The model is trained on the **MovieLens dataset** and provides sequential recommendations.  

## 🚀 Features  
- ✅ **LSTM-based model** for sequential movie recommendations  
- ✅ **Uses past 5 watched movies** to predict the next movie  
- ✅ **Trained on real user ratings** from the MovieLens dataset  
- ✅ **Embeddings** for learning movie representations  
- ✅ **Predicts next movie ID** based on user history  

## 📌 Dataset  
The model is trained using the **MovieLens dataset** from **GroupLens**.
